**E-Commerce Application - Milestone 2**
Overview
In Milestone 2, the project structure was organized, the frontend and backend setups were completed, and the first user-facing feature, the Login Page, was developed. This milestone laid the groundwork for building a functional and scalable e-commerce application.

Project Folder Structure
The project was divided into two main directories:

Frontend: Contains the React application responsible for the user interface.
Backend: Contains the Node.js server for backend functionalities, preparing for future API integrations.
**Frontend Setup**
A React application was initialized to build the user interface.
Tailwind CSS was installed and configured for utility-first and responsive styling.
The frontend folder includes components, assets, and styles necessary for the application.
**Backend Setup**
A basic Node.js server was set up using Express.js.
Middleware such as CORS and Body-Parser was configured for seamless API integration.
A sample endpoint was added to test server functionality.
**Login Page Development**
A Login Page was created as the first user-facing feature of the application.
The page includes:
Email and Password input fields.
A Sign In button.
A link for users to Sign Up if they donâ€™t have an account.
Styling was implemented using Tailwind CSS, focusing on a clean and user-friendly design.
